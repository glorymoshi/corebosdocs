==== Conclusion ====

As can be seen in the images above the time spent by the getParentTab() method has been reduced significantly. This optimization won't have a big impact in the overall usage of the application, specially because we aren't optimizing the real bottle neck which is elsewhere, but all in all, every little bit helps.
