====== 238: Permit sorting of detail view widget blocks  ======

Issue Reference in Tracker: ~~issue:238~~

===== Detailed Explanation =====

We have added the rendering process of [[en:devel:add_special_block|Detail View Widget blocks]] into the rendering process of normal blocks. This way we start with the normal blocks (so the first block will ALWAYS be a normal block) and mix in the [[en:devel:add_special_block|special Detail View Widget blocks]] in order.

We have enhanced the layout editor so you can easily determine where you want these blocks to appear, exactly as you could already do with the normal blocks.
