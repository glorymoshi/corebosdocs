====== 215: Non admin user can convert himself to admin with specific URL ======

Vulnerability::Issue Reference in Tracker: ~~issue:215~~

[[http://trac.vtiger.com/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/ticket/7714|vtiger CRM Trac Ticket]]
===== Detailed Explanation =====

A specifically crafted URL from a user logged in to the application permits the user to promote himself to admin role and also change the value of **ANY** field on other users profile.

The URL is basically calling the inline Detail View Ajax edit functionality as explained on ticket ~~issue:215~~

The patch committed solves both problems by limiting the editing to current user and admin users and also limiting the edition of the is_admin field only to users with administrative privileges.

Thank you //Muhammed Abdul Salim// for reporting this.
