??? How to extend the session. I keep getting logged out of the program

!!! This issue is not directly related to the application itself. The problem is that sensitive information like the password is saved in the PHP session variables. While that session is alive, the application can pick up the values and authenticate. PHP has a process whereas it eliminates the session variables on a variable time span. When PHP clears the variables, the application cannot authenticate and asks again for the information. 

The PHP variables that control this are the **Garbage Collector** variables. In php.ini is **gc_probablity** default set to 0, because Ubuntu use its cron job for cleaning php session files ([[http://www.appnovation.com/blog/session-garbage-collection-php|more info]]).

You can also increase **session.gc_maxlifetime** in php.ini.

??? Automatic number fields are not sorting correctly. For example, I get TT1, TT11, TT12, TT2,... instead of TT1, TT2, TT3, ..., TT11, TT12

!!! This is because it is not a numeric field but a text field due to the initial text prefix, the whole field is text and text sorts differently than numbers. In fact if you do an alphabetic or dictionary sort you will see that the order is correct.

To fix this, the solution is to add as many zeros 0 as you think you will have numbers. For example, in the above case we could define the numeric part with a length of 3, so it would end up like this: TT001, TT002, TT003, ..., TT011, TT012.  Which will sort correctly for the first 1000 autonumeric field values.

Since you most probably have an incorrect setup you can play around with this query, you will need to run multiple queries based on the Ticket number length. It will add 0's to the number. Thanks VTE

<code SQL>### Select - Testing
SELECT 
  ticketid,
  ticket_no,
  LEFT(ticket_no, 2) AS TT,
  RIGHT(ticket_no, 3) AS num,
  CONCAT(LEFT(ticket_no, 2), '0', RIGHT(ticket_no, 3)) 
FROM
  `vtiger_troubletickets` 
WHERE LENGTH(ticket_no) < 6  AND LENGTH(ticket_no) >= 5</code>

<code>### Update
UPDATE
  `vtiger_troubletickets` 
  SET ticket_no=CONCAT(LEFT(ticket_no, 2), '0', RIGHT(ticket_no, 3)) 
WHERE LENGTH(ticket_no) < 6  AND LENGTH(ticket_no) >= 5</code>

??? How can I reset the admin user password?

!!! Execute this SQL in your database:

<code SQL>update vtiger_users set user_password='$1$ad$hsl2KFybNRnbXBa.b.WWv.', crypt_type='MD5' where id=1;</code>
