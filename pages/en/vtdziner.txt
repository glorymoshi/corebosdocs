====== vtDZiner ======

===== coreBOS 5.5 =====

I installed vtDZiner on coreBOS 5.5 yesterday. I had to manually patch the base file changes because it was breaking webservice enhancements and the PHP 5.4/5.5 support enhancements (among a few others).

{{:devel:extensions:vtdziner_corebos55.zip|I leave here the fully modified files and (more important) the patch}}.
