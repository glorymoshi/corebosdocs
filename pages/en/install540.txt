This is a typical **WAMP/LAMP stack**. All linux distributions have this natively so we recommend you install the packages from your distribution (make sure you have the right versions). On windows download the XAMPP stack from apache friends. You can see the [[http://code.stephenmorley.org/articles/xampp-version-history-apache-mysql-php|list of application versions here]]. You should download [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/xampp/files/XAMPP%20Windows/1.7.7|version 1.7.7 from sourceforge]].

If you have the PHP Suhosin extension installed, this extension adds restrictions to make PHP more secure, but some of these restrictions break coreBOS.

To solve this problem you must change two variables in the suhosin config file: (normally: /etc/php5/conf/suhosin.ini)

<code>suhosin.post.max_vars = 2000
suhosin.request.max_vars = 2000</code>

After this you must restart your apache server.
