??? "report to" field in user profile have some influence in hierarchy and permission?

!!! No - it helps in identifying the owner. Sharing access (record level) permission is based on Roles instead.

??? How to increment maximum file upload. File upload field with message 'Maximum upload size is MB'

!!! Forums and Googles say to edit the php.ini file, increasing both upload_max_filesize and also post_max_size. I set them both to 25M & restarted server, but still no joy.

So then changed config.inc.php for the upload_maxsize to 25000000 and it worked. NOTE: The configuration editor will show a value of 25, (to the right of “(Max 5MB)” but I tested it and it DOES work. Interestingly, it also shows the proper 25M value when the user uploads a file/document.
