!!! I'm not too sure this is very useful. I think it is much better to track your visitor with [[http://www.google.com/analytics/index.html|Google Analytics]] or [[http://piwik.org/|PiWik]] (which is what we usually do), but it should be rather easy to accomplish:

  * create a custom field in CRM
  * in the form create a hidden field for that custom field and fill it in with the _SERVER["REMOTE_ADDR"] value

that's it.

??? I want to create task from the leads/contacts/opportunity/organization's list view so that I can apply various filters while assigning mass events to various leads/contacts/opportunity/organization.

!!! That would have to be programmed if you want a specific button, but you can try this:
  * create a custom field, maybe call it "create task", let it be a checkbox (for simplicity)
  * create a workflow that creates a task when the "create task" field is true and then sets the "create task" field to false
  * now simply mass edit and set the field to true
