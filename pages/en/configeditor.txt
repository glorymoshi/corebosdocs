====== Configuration Editor ======

The **Configuration Editor** extension permits us to edit global configuration variables to adjust the functionality of our application.

All of these variables are saved in the main //config.inc.php// file and can also be edited there. This is just an easy way of modifying those variables without needing access to the server.

The functionality of this extension is straight forward; as soon as we access we are greeted with an edit screen for the available variables and their current value. Clicking on the <wrap em>save button</wrap> will update the //config.inc.php// file and the new values will be available on the next load of any page in the application.

<WRAP center round important 75%>
If the //config.inc.php// file is not editable by the webserver user you will see a warning message indicating this state and you WILL NOT be able to change any variables.
</WRAP>

<WRAP center round alert 75%>
There is a warning message that states:

"**You are editing the configuration details. Please do double check before saving the values.**"

I stress this here again: any incorrect value in any variable will break the WHOLE application, please be careful and use correct values for each variable!

The available variables are:

^Mini Calendar Display|boolean|Calendar on global tool bar|
^World Clock Display|boolean|Clock of the world on global tool bar|

===== Adding new variables =====

To add a new variable to the list we must do three things:
  - add the variable to the //config.inc.php// file (and also //config.templat.php// if we plan to distribute the application as an installable with the new variable)
  - add the variable to //modules/ConfigEditor/config.php// in the array element //$__ConfigEditor_Config['allow.editing.variables']//
  - add the translations to the //modules/ConfigEditor/language// files
