==== Installation Frequently Asked Questions ====

~~QNA~~

??? PHP recommended configuration suggests to set display_error = ON and log_errors = OFF. Thats is oposite recommendation for all installation ... Is that correct?

!!! I'm not sure what others recommend. I know that it could be a security issue but in general you should not be getting any errors so display_error will never show anything. When it does, the screen capture that the user can send us will be much more valuable than a typical "it doesn't work" or "it gives me a blank screen". I mean, errors MUST be fixed, and we need information to fix them. So I think it is good.  In any case, you can set it as you want because this does not affect the functionality of the application.
