====== Lead Conversion ======

Once a business opportunity emerges, the Lead can be converted to a Opportunity. At this time, the data contained within the lead are automatically split out into a contact and an organization and the Lead is deleted. Information about the specific business opportunity is stored as a Opportunity. All the information collected for the Lead is still available but is now split between Contacts, Organizations and Opportunities.
