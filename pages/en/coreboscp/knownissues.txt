=====Search doesn't work correctly=====

Sadly there isn't much I can do here since it is a problem of vtiger CRM REST interface. The problem is that vtiger CRM REST does not support parenthesis in VQL, so when I look for the quotes related to the contact who has logged in (for example), I execute this VQL:

<code>select * from quotes where accountid=xx or contactid=yy</code>

when we search on quotes, this gets converted to:

<code>select * from quotes where accountid=xx or contactid=yy and condition1 and condition2</code>

this retrieves all the quotes that belong to the account AND those that fulfill the conditions and belong to the contact. The correct way to do this is:

<code>select * from quotes where (accountid=xx or contactid=yy) and condition1 and condition2</code>

but we cannot use the parenthesis in VQL, so, short of reprogramming VQL there is nothing better I can do.

I trust this will be fixed in the future.
