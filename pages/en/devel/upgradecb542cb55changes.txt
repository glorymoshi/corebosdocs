====== coreBOS 5.4.0 to coreBOS 5.5.0 Changes======

===== Comments on important changes =====

This release is all about two things:
  - **PHP 5.4 and 5.5 support and code cleanup.**  coreBOS now runs correctly on PHP 5.4 and PHP 5.5. Besides fixing the code we have started upgrading the libraries and documenting the dependencies and are relentlessly hunting down all the notice and warning messages (we have eliminated hundreds already).
  - **REST enhancements: [[http://corebos.org/documentation/doku.php?id=en:devel:coreboscp|Customer Portal]].** from coreBOS 5.5 forward we have a whole new set of webservice functionality to support advanced application development like our [[http://corebos.org/documentation/doku.php?id=en:devel:coreboscp|coreBOSCP Customer Portal Project]] and many others.


There are a few more important things that are worth detailing next and all the changes can be found below with full details on the tickets, some even have their own wiki page with an additional explanation, this is just a quick relation of the work done in this release.
