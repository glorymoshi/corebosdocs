===== coreBOS advanced webform creation and validation =====

**This project takes webforms to the next level.**
</WRAP>

coreBOS has a native webform creation and implementation feature that permits us to create a webform for a given module (accounts, contacts, leads, potentials, helpdesk,...) but in many cases, somebody filling in information on our website isn't just one entity in coreBOS. For example, somebody filling in a contact form may already be interested in some product and should be converted into a Contact **AND** an Opportunity, or when filling in a support form we should get a Contact **AND** a HelpDesk. That is what this project does, it is an easy way to convert fields captured from our webform into different entities in coreBOS.

While we were at it we added the **typical validation of fields**, so you can make sure a given field is not repeated or already exists before sending the information in to the application.
