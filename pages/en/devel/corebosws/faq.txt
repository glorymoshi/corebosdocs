~~QNA~~

??? Using the count(*) operator in VQL, How do I get the number from the returned result?

!!! The result returned is an array of one row, that contains an array with one element which is the count result. That result can be accessed as index 0 or with the key 'count':
<code>Array(
   [0] => Array(
       [count] => 12
   )
)</code>
