====== Google Integration in Calendar module ======

===== Google Synchronization =====

You can view or synchronize your Google events with your coreBOS events using the Calendar. Firstly you have to [[en:calendar_google_integration#configuring_your_connection_with_google_calendar|set up your Google account/credentials]].

  * In case you have more calendars within your Google account, please select the calendar which you would like to use. Please note that one activity type can be synchronized with only one Google calendar.

{{ :en:corebos:calendar:4_4_google_sync_settings.png?600 |}}

  * An additional step is to define export and import i.e. synchronization:
    * Export “activity_name” to calendar – checked means that all new created events in the Calendar will be also exported and visible in the Google calendar. In addition any change of these events will be synchronized towards Google calendar. These events are marked with an icon.
    * Import from calendar to “activity_name” - checked means that all new created events in Google calendar will be also visible in the Calendar. In addition any change of these events in Google calendar will be synchronized towards the Calendar. These events are marked with an icon and are not editable on the Calendar side.
  * Click on the [Save] button to save the synchronization settings.

The Calendar allows you to add Google events into coreBOS (see blue link “Add into coreBOS” in the below picture). Please click on this link to add this event to coreBOS.

<WRAP center round important 70%>Important note: Events added from Google to coreBOS have to be updated/edited/moved in the Calendar only (not in the Google calendar) in order to synchronize the changes done in the Calendar towards Google calendar.</WRAP>



===== Setup calendar event synchronization =====

In the image below you can see a simple example of synchronization with Google via separate activity “//Google events//”. These are the steps:

  * Using CRM Settings > Picklist Editor create a new Activity Type for “Events” called “//Google events//” (you can name it as you wish).
  * In your Google calendar create a new separate calendar – in the example the name used was //ITS4You meetings// (again, you can name it according to your needs).
  * Set up synchronization with Google calendar by clicking on the small "down" arrow that appears when you hover over the newly created event.
  * You will see that “//Google events//” are visible in both Calendars with a separate activity type and color.

{{ :en:corebos:calendar:6_1_synch_with_google.png?600 |}}

We implement this approach so it is easy to define which events should be imported to and from Google. It is also suitable in case you don’t need to synchronize your activities with Google anymore and you want to deactivated it.

===== Configuring your connection with Google Calendar =====

<WRAP center round important 70%>**Starting at coreBOS release December 2014**</WRAP>

We have updated Google Integration from API v.1 //(already deprecated by Google)// to the newest API v.3.

The integration is being done through Web Application Client ID, which lets a user login to Google Calendar in background by previously entering three parameters: 
  * API Key, 
  * Client ID.
  * Client Secret
  * Redirect URL.

Due to Google Security issues, integration does not require user's email password anymore. So you just to config this parameters and validate for **admin user**, the rest of users, just click in **//Authorize and Connect//** link to give permission to manage and share their calendars.
