====== Google Integration in Calendar module ======

===== Google Synchronization =====

You can view or synchronize your Google events with your coreBOS events using the Calendar. Firstly you have to [[en:calendar_google_integration#configuring_your_connection_with_google_calendar|set up your Google account/credentials]].

  * In case you have more calendars within your Google account, please select the calendar which you would like to use. Please note that one activity type can be synchronized with only one Google calendar.

{{ :en:corebos:calendar:4_4_google_sync_settings.png?600 |}}

  * An additional step is to define export and import i.e. synchronization:
    * Export “activity_name” to calendar – checked means that all new created events in the Calendar will be also exported and visible in the Google calendar. In addition any change of these events will be synchronized towards Google calendar. These events are marked with an icon.
    * Import from calendar to “activity_name” - checked means that all new created events in Google calendar will be also visible in the Calendar. In addition any change of these events in Google calendar will be synchronized towards the Calendar. These events are marked with an icon and are not editable on the Calendar side.
  * Click on the [Save] button to save the synchronization settings.

The Calendar allows you to add Google events into coreBOS (see blue link “Add into coreBOS” in the below picture). Please click on this link to add this event to coreBOS.

<WRAP center round important 70%>Important note: Events added from Google to coreBOS have to be updated/edited/moved in the Calendar only (not in the Google calendar) in order to synchronize the changes done in the Calendar towards Google calendar.</WRAP>



===== Setup calendar event synchronization =====

In the image below you can see a simple example of synchronization with Google via separate activity “//Google events//”. These are the steps:

  * Using CRM Settings > Picklist Editor create a new Activity Type for “Events” called “//Google events//” (you can name it as you wish).
  * In your Google calendar create a new separate calendar – in the example the name used was //ITS4You meetings// (again, you can name it according to your needs).
  * Set up synchronization with Google calendar by clicking on the small "down" arrow that appears when you hover over the newly created event.
  * You will see that “//Google events//” are visible in both Calendars with a separate activity type and color.

We implement this approach so it is easy to define which events should be imported to and from Google. It is also suitable in case you don’t need to synchronize your activities with Google anymore and you want to deactivated it.

===== Configuring your connection with Google Calendar =====

<WRAP center round important 70%>**Starting at coreBOS release December 2014**</WRAP>

We have updated Google Integration from API v.1 //(already deprecated by Google)// to the newest API v.3.

The integration is being done through Service Account, which lets a user login to Google Calendar in background by previously entering three parameters: 
  * API Key, 
  * Service Account Client ID.
  * p12 Key file.

Due to Google Security issues, integration does not require user's email password anymore. So a user has to configure his Google Account in order to get those three values and give privileged access to certain calendars.


=====Here's a step by step guide to help you configure your Google Account.=====

1.- Go to the link [[https://console.developers.google.com/project]]

2.- Create your project

{{ :createproj.png?700 |}}

3.- Go to the Project. Click API in **APIs&auth** section and activate the Calendar API

{{ :calendarapi.png?700 |}}

4.- Go to the Credentials section and create the Public API Key by clicking **Create New Key**. Choose Server Key

{{ :createapikey.png?700 |}}

5.- Create Service Account by clicking **Create New Client ID** in the OAuth section. Choose Service Account Option

{{ :serviceacc.png?700 |}}

6.- Automatically a file will be downloaded. Save it. It is the Key file you will need as one of the three parameters. 

{{ :p12file.png?700 |}}

7.- You'll get a view like the next image. The selected text is the Client Id or the second parameter you'll need (only put that part) and the API Key is the third one. 

{{ :serviceacckey.png?700 |}}

8.- Now Copy the Email Address field of the Service Account 

{{ :emailservacc.png?700 |}}

9.- Now go into your Google Calendar. Open the **Settings** (up on the right corner of the calendar). Go into the second tab, **Calendars** and choose the Calendar/s you want to share with coreBOS Calendar

{{ :calendars.png?700 |}}

10.- Choose the second tab, **Share this Calendar** and in the Share with specific persons section Paste the Email address previously copied. Give **write access** to that email address and Save. Do this for the other calendars as well.

{{ :share.png?700 |}}

11.- Make sure the **Calendar API** is active in your project by going to **API** and activating it. Calendar API should appear in the list of active APIs

{{ :calendargoogleapiactive.png?500 |}}

12.- Now your configuration is done. All you have to do is go into coreBOS Calendar Module. Click the **Setting** button and upload the p12 file you previously downloaded. 

{{ :upload.png?700 |}}

{{ :googlekeys.png?700 |}}

13.- Now you can put the three configuration parameters in the three fields. 

{{ :calconfig.png?700 |}}

14.- And choose the calendar you want to synchronize on the right of Call or Meeting Activity List

{{ :calselect.png?700 |}}

15.- Create an event and you'll see it on Google Calendar

{{ :event.png?700 |}}

That's it. Enjoy!
