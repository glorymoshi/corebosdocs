===== CORS Support for Webservice =====

<WRAP center round important 85%>For CORS support it is necessary to manually change your //config.inc.php// (~~issue:208~~).
    - edit //config.inc.php//
    - move towards the end of the file although you can really add the variable wherever you want
    - add this code:<code>// List of CORS Authorized Domains for Webservices
$cors_enabled_domains = '';
</code>
    - save the file
