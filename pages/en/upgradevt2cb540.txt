====== Upgrade from vtiger CRM 5.4.0 to coreBOS 5.4.0 ======

<WRAP center round info 70%>The process detailed below is valid, but, the existence of coreBOS Updater has changed everything and made upgrading and keeping up to date MUCH easier. [[en:upgradevt2cb|The process detailed here is easier]].</WRAP>


This first set of changes is basically paperwork; apply all the patches and enhancements we have developed along the way and that have been shared in the developer's list and trac.

[[en:devel:upgradevt2cb54changes|You can find the full details of the changes made on this page]].

Many of those changes will be useful by themselves if you have a vtiger CRM 5.4. You can apply only those you need individually but I encourage you to upgrade to coreBOS 5.4 because after this upgrade it is just going to get better and we will be adding a lot of interesting things.

Upgrading is work better suited for a developer who is comfortable playing with the code, but I will try to explain the process in detail to make it easier.

**Backup your files and database**, there should be no problem, all the code is tested and the process is not invasive, if there is a problem **we will help**, this is just a precautionary step and another good reason to make a backup of your information

===== You have a clean vtiger CRM 5.4 =====

You can proceed in two ways, either use the fully patched zip upgrade package or apply the patch.

==== Fully patched zip upgrade ====
  - backup your files and database, there should be no problem, all the code is tested, if there is a problem we will help, this is just a precautionary step and another good reason to make a backup of your information
  - {{:devel:vtigercrm54_to_corebos54.zip|download the upgrade package from here}}
  - copy it to the root of your current vtiger CRM 5.4
  - unzip it overwriting all files
  - you can also uncompress the files locally and upload them to your server via FTP
  - execute the database changes, there are only two changes and some files that aren't used anymore are eliminated.
    - Go to your browser
    - login to your coreBOS 5.4
    - edit the URL box and eliminate all the text starting from index.php
    - add upgrade2coreBOS.php<WRAP center round info 60%>
It should look like this:<code>http://your_server/your_crm/upgrade2coreBOS.php</code>
</WRAP>
  - execute the script and you should get a green screen with some messages about the actions executed, at the end of the screen you should have none of the steps in red

Your done. Enjoy!

===== You have a modified vtiger CRM 5.4 =====

There is not much I can say here; you need a developer to weed through the changes and adapt your version with the new changes. We are tending towards making these updates less traumatic but, at this moment, we still have a little bit to go.

Your developer will have to evaluate which of the previous two scenarios is best for him and take it from there.

===== You have your vtiger CRM 5.4 under GIT version control =====

This is ideal as you can add a remote to our [[https://github.com/tsolucio/corebos|GitHub project (https://github.com/tsolucio/corebos)]] and follow our development as we move along. You still have to play around with the code and apply patches but GIT is going to help you a lot.

So the steps here are identical to the three situations described before just that GIT will do the patching for you and help you along the way once you have added the remote link.
